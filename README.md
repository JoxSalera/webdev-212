# Welcome to WebDev 212 Paris

Hello WebDev Paris 212!

Kicking off on 21st February 2022, we'll have 9 weeks to become full-stack web developers.

## Who's the team?

Your instructional team includes:

- Robin James Kerrison
- Pauline Bertrand
- Florian Aube

## Student info

If you need student info, there's a little script.

Try

```
./students.sh list table
```

for a format that can be copied into Google sheets.

Alternatively,

```
./students.sh random name,projects.0.github
```

will output json with the chosen fields.

### Viewing projects

```
./students.sh view
```

will choose a random student and open their project 1 deployment.

## Generating groups

```sh
./students.sh groups 2
```

This will generate pairs. Change the number, change the group size.

The last group may be smaller â€” handle this manually for now.
