# Our first express app

This is the most basic an express app can be.

It listens to one route (`/home`), on a hardcoded port (`3000`), and it returns an `<h1>` as a response.

## Running the server

We can run the server with just

```sh
node app.js
```

We can then view the response to our `/home` route at
[http://localhost:3000/home](http://localhost:3000/home).
Try it!
